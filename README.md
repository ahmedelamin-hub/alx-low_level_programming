This repository contains assignments focused on low-level programming using the C programming language. The goal is to understand how C interacts with system-level resources, including memory management, pointers, and data structures. You will learn how to work with memory allocation, create efficient algorithms, and manage hardware resources at a low level. This foundational knowledge will strengthen your ability to write optimized and high-performance software.

Requirements
A C compiler (e.g., GCC).

A basic understanding of C syntax, variables, and functions.

Familiarity with memory concepts such as pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and stack vs heap.

A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code, CLion, or Sublime Text for writing C code.

Knowledge of basic algorithms and data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists).
